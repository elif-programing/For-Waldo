                    <p class="paragraph">You should be proud of yourself... for being the way you are and all of 
                        your achievements. You might ask: What achievemnts? Achievements don't 
                        always have to be something you can see or touch. The most
                        important achievements are the ones that build character and your mindset.
                        The one thing that makes you who you are is the best thing to
                        invest in. In yourself! You are worth all good things in this world.
                        Be kind to yourself. You live for the first time and the mistakes you made
                        don't define you. They are failures. But you know.. failures are good things.
                        If someone told you, you are 20 failures away from becoming who you want to be,
                        how would you feel? You would probably want to get through those failures fast
                        so you can learn from your mistakes and reach another level of your personal 
                        growth. Our decisions shape us. So does our mindset and the way we view the world.
                        Look at yourself with grace (Corinthians 12:9) 
                        You are trying. And trying to be someone better every day with small steps is the
                        exact way to achieve real change. You are shaping yourself. Be patient it takes time 
                        to be someone you haven't been before. You are doing great. You came so so far.
                        You reached so many highs and lows and learned a lot of valuable lessons. So much 
                        knowledge and experience.</p></div>

                            You are a really passionate person. I like to describe it that way because 
                            when you begin something like a project, you put your heart and soul into it.
                            Your effort and dedication are so admirable. When you want something you are a

                            and build empathy. But not only that.. you are so precious that you feel with the

                            mindset and don't let others tell you otherwise. You are not afraid to be yourself.
                            Your morals are right and you do not depend on other people's opinion to what is wrong or right.
